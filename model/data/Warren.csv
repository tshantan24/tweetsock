"Workers from Sears, Toys “R” Us, &amp; Shopko have had to fight tooth &amp; nail for their pay, severance, &amp; pensions.

"Our new #StopWallStreetLooting Act would:

✔️Put private investment funds on the hook for their companies' debt &amp; liabilities
✔️End corporate looting through excessive fees &amp; dividends
✔️Protects workers' jobs &amp; severance
✔️Safeguard the markets from risky corporate debt"
"When companies like Sears fail, workers lose everything. But the private equity &amp; investment funds? They collect huge fees &amp; move on to the next big deal. It’s time to #StopWallStreetLooting to protect workers &amp; hold private equity accountable."

"@SenatorBaldwin @SenSherrodBrown @repmarkpocan @RepJayapal When I was a kid, my mom’s job at Sears saved our family. But that Sears doesn’t exist today. Neither does Payless, Shopko, or Gymboree.

"Private equity firms want you to believe you’re not smart enough to understand their business model. But it's pretty simple: take over companies &amp; loot 'em.

Today the Supreme Court threw up its hands &amp; declared it can’t rein in partisan gerrymandering – can’t protect Americans’ constitutional rights to participate in their democracy equally &amp; choose their representatives. It's a shameful blow to the functioning of our democracy.
It’s time for the Senate to pass the #EqualityAct to finally ban discrimination against LGBTQ people. And Congress should pass my Refund Equality Act so legally married same-sex couples can finally get the tax refunds they should have received but were denied.
